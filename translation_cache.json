The random code is composed of timestamp field and field generated by an operating system level encrypted secure random generation function, ensuring the uniqueness of the random code generation.\n2. Use AES128 algorithm for authorization result calculation, with key values stored in obfuscated segments. Users use the company's Welink platform authorization calculation module to decrypt and generate a decryption authorization code based on a random code. Compare the encrypted authorization code with the decrypted authorization code on the display end to see if they match. If they match, the authentication is successful and the user will be redirected to the upgrade interface. If they do not match, the random code will be updated.\n3.
